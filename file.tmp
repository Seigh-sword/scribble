# Scribble Setup Guide

## One-Click Installation

Scribble has **automatic installers** that handle everything for you!

### On Linux/Mac

**Step 1:** Download the installer
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seigh-sword/scribble/main/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Step 2:** That's it! The installer will:
 - ✓ Download the latest release
 - ✓ Install everything you need

**Step 3:** Reload your shell and use it:
```bash
scribble build
scribble check
scribble test
```

### On Windows

**Step 1:** Download `install.bat` from the repo
```
https://github.com/Seigh-sword/scribble/raw/main/install.bat
```

**Step 2:** Double-click `install.bat` and it will:
 - ✓ Download the latest release (Zip with DLLs)
 - ✓ Install everything you need

**Step 3:** Close and reopen Command Prompt, then:
```cmd
scribble build
scribble help
```

## Auto-Update System

After installation, Scribble can be updated by re-running the installer.
(Automatic updates are planned for a future version).

## What Gets Installed

```
~/.scribble/                (Linux/Mac)
%APPDATA%\Scribble\         (Windows)
├── build/                  (Compiled files)
├── bin/                    (Executables + DLLs)
├── compiler/               (Source code)
├── attributes/             (Rust crates)
└── ... (all Scribble files)
```

## Requirements

None! Just download and run.

## Usage After Installation

```bash
scribble build              # Build everything
scribble check              # Check all files
scribble test               # Run tests
scribble compile <file>     # Compile .scrib files
scribble tree               # Show project structure
scribble help               # Show all commands
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: scribble"**
 - Check that `%APPDATA%\Scribble\bin` (Windows) or `~/.scribble/bin` (Mac/Linux) is in your PATH.

## Manual Installation (Advanced)

If installers don't work:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Seigh-sword/scribble.git
cd scribble
chmod +x ses launcher.sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
./ses build
```

Then use:
```bash
./launcher.sh build    # With auto-updates
./ses build            # Without auto-updates
```
