So, you dont get it? 

no worries I will tell you so, 
instead of making 100+ COMMANDS we just took 1 command and turned it, into a folder
for commands so, its all in there not different just taht but inside it, so 

make:

- time.

has date, day and every single thing we need about it, dont just build 2 or 3 build more,
or I will be mad

- system

just like os from python but more, add all of the commands from that here,

- canvas

the most important and crusiosial its litterally named scribble dont you think we cant.
ya, so its like opengl or pygame or twinker like all of them together with react combined togther 
yes we also, have the css and react things the icons and all no whate ever.

please I dont have no ideas ad more like 4 or 3 please! or I will get upset and build

attributes.json

to tell what all commands execute which which rust files and all, its complex so, please deal with it.
